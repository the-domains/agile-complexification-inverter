Cultivating Collaboration via intense partnerships to solve problems.

I presented this workshop at Agile Camp - Dallas, Oct 19th. 

[DFW Scrum Meeting Aug. 18th 2015][0]

It's said that two heads are better than one, in reference to problem solving. We will use Tangram puzzles to simulate this experience, and via structured debriefs of these exercises, discover the powerful behaviors of awesome collaboration, and the negative warning signs of poor collaboration. We will jump right into simulation exercises, come prepared to have FUN and learn by doing. 

No lecture - if you want a lecture... go here:

Here are some of the resources and exercise if you wish to reproduce this workshop or want to dig further into the science behind collaboration.
