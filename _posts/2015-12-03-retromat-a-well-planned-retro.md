Retro process phases: Set the Stage, Gather Data, Generate Insight, Decide what to Do, Close the Retro

REF:  http://plans-for-retrospectives.com 

* Set the Stage: give time to "arrive" and get into the right mood and focus upon the goal
* Gather Data: reflect upon what happened, create a shared pool of information
* Generate Insight: why did things happen this way? What patterns can we observe?
* Decide What to Do: Pick what to work on, plan concrete steps of action

Close the Retro: reflect upon the retrospective, how could it improve? What shall we follow-up upon?

**Activities for this Retro:**

**Quick Questions **

In ONE word -- what do you need from the retro?In ONE word -- what is on your mind?

* Explorer -- eager to dive in and research what worked
* Shopper -- Positive, happy if 1 good thing come out
* Vacationer -- Reluctant, but retros beat regular work
* Prisoner -- Only attend because they make you
